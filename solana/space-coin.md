## Audit Summary

Space Coin is a Token-2022 asset with fully revoked mint and freeze authorities, providing a secure foundation for holders. Liquidity is fully burned, preventing rug-pull risks via liquidity withdrawal. Holder concentration data is unavailable, and the token is newly launched with high trading volume relative to liquidity.

> **Final Recommendation:** Investors should monitor the token's liquidity depth as the pair matures, as the current volume-to-liquidity ratio suggests high volatility. Since holder concentration data is unavailable, users should exercise caution regarding potential whale activity and price slippage during large trades.

## Security Findings

_⚪ 6 Informational_

### `I-01` — No code-level findings — an SPL mint exposes no auditable program source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

This token is an SPL token mint, not a deployed program: there is no contract source code on-chain for a line-by-line review, so no code-level vulnerability could be identified either way. The assessment on this page therefore rests on mint/owner authority, mint capability, LP lock/burn state, which are read directly from chain state and from third-party risk registries.

**Recommendation:** Read the risk score breakdown below as the substance of this audit. For a code-level review, the token would need an accompanying verified program.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $13K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $135K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun, a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $13K of DEX liquidity across 16 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun, under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
