# Sexbot (SEXBOT) — Smart Contract Security Analysis | Solana

> **Risk Score: 24/100 — 🟢 Low Risk**

---

## Audit Summary

The Sexbot token utilizes the Token-2022 program with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. While the liquidity is fully burned, the token exhibits a high volume-to-liquidity ratio, suggesting potential wash trading. Holder concentration data is unavailable, and third-party registry data indicates no adverse flags.

> **Final Recommendation:** Investors should exercise caution regarding the high volume-to-liquidity ratio, which may indicate artificial market activity. Monitor the token on-chain to ensure no unexpected changes in market depth.

Verify the token's current supply and market activity via block explorers. Given the lack of holder distribution data, maintain a position size commensurate with the risk of high volatility in low-liquidity environments.

## Security Findings

_🟠 1 High · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `H-01` — Wash Trading Signal  *(Severity: High · Status: Unresolved)*

The 24-hour volume-to-liquidity ratio is 55.34, which significantly exceeds the 20x threshold, indicating a pattern strongly associated with artificially inflated trade volume.

**Recommendation:** Exercise caution when interpreting volume metrics; perform independent analysis of trade frequency and order book depth.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $26K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $990K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun, a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $26K of DEX liquidity across 13 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun, under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
