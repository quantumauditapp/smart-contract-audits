## Audit Summary

The Wabi token (CMK5SEFQw3DDs6iGTBBAHeyQyMnBgtZvFnUp6tYwabi) is a standard SPL token with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. Liquidity is fully locked, and no adverse flags were reported by third-party registries. Holder distribution data was unavailable, preventing a full assessment of supply concentration.

> **Final Recommendation:** The token is technically sound regarding authority revocation and liquidity security. Users should monitor the token's market activity and liquidity depth on-chain to ensure slippage remains within acceptable bounds for their trade sizes.

As holder distribution data was unavailable, participants should exercise standard caution regarding potential whale activity. Verify the mint address directly on a block explorer before interacting to ensure you are transacting with the correct asset.

## Security Findings

_⚪ 6 Informational_

### `I-01` — No code-level findings — an SPL mint exposes no auditable program source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

This token is an SPL token mint, not a deployed program: there is no contract source code on-chain for a line-by-line review, so no code-level vulnerability could be identified either way. The assessment on this page therefore rests on mint/owner authority, mint capability, LP lock/burn state, which are read directly from chain state and from third-party risk registries.

**Recommendation:** Read the risk score breakdown below as the substance of this audit. For a code-level review, the token would need an accompanying verified program.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity locked with no expiry  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's liquidity is locked for good in Raydium's LP locker (Burn & Earn) — only its trading fees can be collected; no one can withdraw the liquidity.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $38K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $252K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $38K of DEX liquidity across 3 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
