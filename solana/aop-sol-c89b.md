# AOP (AOP) — Smart Contract Security Analysis | Solana

> **Risk Score: 0/100 — 🟢 Low Risk**

## Audit Summary

The AOP token is a standard SPL Token-2022 implementation with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. Liquidity is fully secured via 100% burning of LP tokens, mitigating risks of rug pulls. Holder distribution data was unavailable, preventing a full assessment of concentration risk.

> **Final Recommendation:** The token configuration is secure. Users should monitor the token's market activity and liquidity depth on-chain to ensure continued stability. 

Verify the current supply and authority status using a block explorer to confirm that no unauthorized minting or freezing capabilities have been introduced via secondary programs.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 10/10 | Low | The token utilizes the Token-2022 program with no active extensions like transfer hooks or default frozen states. 7.1 Architecture is standard for SPL tokens. 7.2 Code Security is inherent to the… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 10/10 | Low | 7.4 Economic stability is supported by $2.4M in liquidity, which is 100% burned. 7.5 Governance is decentralized due to the revocation of minting capabilities. 7.6 External signals indicate high… |
| **Upgrades** | 10/10 | Low | 7.7 Upgrades are not applicable as the mint is immutable. 7.8 Operations are stable; metadata is immutable, ensuring branding consistency. No further changes to the token program configuration are… |

## Security Findings

_⚪ 6 Informational_

### `I-01` — No code-level findings — an SPL mint exposes no auditable program source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

This token is an SPL token mint, not a deployed program: there is no contract source code on-chain for a line-by-line review, so no code-level vulnerability could be identified either way. The assessment on this page therefore rests on mint/owner authority, mint capability, LP lock/burn state, which are read directly from chain state and from third-party risk registries.

**Recommendation:** Read the risk score breakdown below as the substance of this audit. For a code-level review, the token would need an accompanying verified program.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $2.4M (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $1.3M (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun, a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $2.4M of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun, under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (4/4 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| No Mint Function | ✅ Pass |
| Liquidity Locked | ✅ Pass |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| No Mint Function | ✅ | No mint function — total supply cannot be inflated. |
| Liquidity Locked | ✅ | Liquidity is locked — reduces the rug-pull risk. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
