## Audit Summary

The POKEHOOD token utilizes the Token-2022 program with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. While the liquidity is fully burned, the token exhibits a high volume-to-liquidity ratio, suggesting potential wash trading. Holder concentration data was unavailable from the provided sources.

> **Final Recommendation:** Investors should monitor the token's trading activity, as the high volume-to-liquidity ratio may indicate artificial market activity. Since holder concentration data is unavailable, users should exercise caution regarding potential whale activity that could impact price stability.

Verify the current mint and freeze authority status using a block explorer to ensure they remain null. Given the lack of holder distribution data, perform a manual check of the largest token accounts on-chain before executing large trades to assess individual wallet exposure.

## Security Findings

_🟠 1 High · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `H-01` — Wash Trading Signal  *(Severity: High · Status: Unresolved)*

The 24-hour volume/liquidity ratio is 24.19, which exceeds the 20x threshold, indicating a pattern associated with artificially inflated trade volume.

**Recommendation:** Exercise caution when trading; the liquidity may not support the reported volume levels.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $20K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $576K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun, a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $20K of DEX liquidity across 8 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun, under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
