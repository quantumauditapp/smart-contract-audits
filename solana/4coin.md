## Audit Summary

The 4coin token utilizes the Token-2022 program with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. While liquidity is fully burned, the token exhibits a high volume-to-liquidity ratio, suggesting potential wash trading. Holder concentration data was unavailable from the provided sources.

> **Final Recommendation:** Investors should exercise caution regarding the high volume-to-liquidity ratio, which may not represent organic market demand. Monitor the token on-chain to verify that no new accounts are accumulating excessive supply, as holder distribution data was unavailable at the time of this audit.

Verify the mint and freeze authority status directly on a block explorer to confirm they remain set to null. Given the high trading volume relative to liquidity, ensure that slippage settings are configured appropriately before executing any swaps.

## Security Findings

_🟠 1 High · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `H-01` — Wash Trading Signal  *(Severity: High · Status: Unresolved)*

The 24-hour volume-to-liquidity ratio is 59.08, which exceeds the threshold of 20, indicating potential artificial trade volume.

**Recommendation:** Monitor trading activity for organic growth and be aware that liquidity depth may be insufficient for large orders despite high reported volume.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $30K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $1.3M (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun, a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $30K of DEX liquidity across 9 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun, under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
