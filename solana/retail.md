# Retail (RETAIL) — Smart Contract Security Analysis | Solana

> **Risk Score: 13/100 — 🟢 Low Risk**

## Audit Summary

The Retail (RETAIL) token is a standard SPL Token-2022 implementation with both mint and freeze authorities successfully revoked. While the liquidity is fully burned, the token exhibits a high volume-to-liquidity ratio, suggesting potential wash trading. Holder concentration data was unavailable from the provided sources.

> **Final Recommendation:** Investors should monitor the high trading volume relative to liquidity, as this often indicates artificial activity that may not reflect genuine market demand. Given the lack of holder distribution data, users should exercise caution regarding potential whale activity that could impact price stability.

Verify the current liquidity status on-chain to ensure the burn remains intact. No further administrative actions are required as the token authorities are already revoked.

## Security Findings

_🟠 1 High · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `H-01` — Wash Trading Signal  *(Severity: High · Status: Unresolved)*

The 24-hour volume/liquidity ratio is 30.69, which is significantly higher than the 20x threshold, indicating potential wash trading.

**Recommendation:** Exercise caution when evaluating market demand and price discovery for this asset.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the pool's LP tokens are burned — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone. This assessment covers the main pool, which holds 54% of the token's DEX liquidity; the other pools were not assessed.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $99K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $1.5M (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Meme token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A community token whose value comes from attention rather than a product. Being a meme is not a risk in itself: it is scored on exactly the same contract and market facts as any other token. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: launched on pump.fun (PumpSwap), a meme launchpad. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: nobody (ownership renounced). Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $99K of DEX liquidity across 30 pools. Launch: launched on pump.fun (PumpSwap), under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Expect attention-driven volatility; the facts in this report say whether the contract itself can be used against holders.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.
