# Rocco (ROCCO) — Smart Contract Security Analysis | Ethereum

> **Risk Score: 8/100 — 🟢 Low Risk**

---

## Audit Summary

The audited contract is a standard ERC-20 token implementation utilizing OpenZeppelin libraries. It follows industry-standard patterns for token transfers, approvals, and metadata management. No privileged roles or administrative backdoors were identified in the codebase.

> **Final Recommendation:** The contract is secure and follows standard implementation patterns. No further action is required for the current codebase.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 10/10 | Low | The architecture follows the standard OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation, ensuring high compatibility with DeFi protocols. Code security is robust due to the use of audited, battle-tested libraries… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 10/10 | Low | The contract does not implement any governance or economic mechanisms. It functions purely as a standard asset transfer utility. No external dependencies or complex economic logic exist to manipulate. |
| **Upgrades** | 10/10 | Low | The contract is immutable and does not utilize any proxy patterns. There are no upgrade paths or administrative functions that could alter the contract logic post-deployment. |

## LP Distribution

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **LP Burned** | ✅ 100.0% (≈ permanent lock) |
| **LP Locked** | 100.0% — Dead Address |

## Security Findings

_⚪ 7 Informational_

### `I-01` — No issues identified in the reviewed source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The verified source code was reviewed and no issue rising to Informational severity or above was identified. This is a statement about the code that was read, not a guarantee: the review covers the published source only. Fact-layer checks (mint capability, LP lock/burn state) were applied separately and feed the risk score.

**Recommendation:** Re-check after any contract upgrade or ownership change, both of which can alter behaviour without changing this page.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The holder list from the security indexer adds up to 120.0% of supply, so it does not describe real balances. That happens with rebasing and reflection tokens, whose balances change without transfers, and with contracts that report balances they do not hold. Concentration is unknown and priced as an unknown — neither a whale nor safe.

**Recommendation:** Check the largest holders on the block explorer, which reads current balances.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

317 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity burned — cannot be withdrawn  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

100.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% of the LP tokens were sent to a burn address — that liquidity can never be withdrawn by anyone. Some pools are concentrated-liquidity (V3/V4) positions; shares above are by position as GoPlus reports them.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $98K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $686K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: an owner that could not be resolved. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $98K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (4/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ⚠️ Unknown |
| No Mint Function | ✅ Pass |
| Liquidity Locked | ✅ Pass |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ⚠️ | Could not be determined from the explorer or on-chain reads — treat as unverified rather than safe. |
| No Mint Function | ✅ | No mint function — total supply cannot be inflated. |
| Liquidity Locked | ✅ | Liquidity is locked — reduces the rug-pull risk. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
