# AudaCity (DACITYCOIN) — Smart Contract Security Analysis | Ethereum

## Audit Summary

The contract is a standard, immutable ERC-20 token implementation. It lacks any privileged administrative functions, backdoors, or complex logic, making it highly secure by design. The code adheres strictly to the OpenZeppelin ERC-20 standard.

> **Final Recommendation:** The contract is secure and requires no modifications. Users should ensure they interact only with the verified contract address provided.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 6/10 | Medium | The architecture follows the standard OpenZeppelin ERC-20 implementation, ensuring 7.1 Architecture and 7.2 Code Security compliance. 7.3 Access Control is inherently secure as no privileged roles… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 2/10 | High | 7.4 Economic and 7.5 Governance factors are not applicable as the contract is a simple token without staking, minting, or voting mechanisms. The token supply is fixed upon deployment. There are no… |
| **Upgrades** | 6/10 | Medium | 7.7 Upgrades are not supported, ensuring the contract logic is immutable. 7.8 Operations are straightforward with no administrative overhead. The lack of proxy patterns eliminates risks associated… |

## Security Findings

_🟠 1 High · ⚪ 6 Informational_

### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity withdrawable by the owner/deployer  *(Severity: High · Status: Acknowledged)*

0.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% is held, unlocked, by the token's owner/deployer (0x54e4…3abd) — they can pull that liquidity at any moment. This is the rug-pull path. Some pools are concentrated-liquidity (V3/V4) positions; shares above are by position as GoPlus reports them.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `I-01` — No issues identified in the reviewed source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The verified source code was reviewed and no issue rising to Informational severity or above was identified. This is a statement about the code that was read, not a guarantee: the review covers the published source only. Fact-layer checks (mint capability) were applied separately and feed the risk score.

**Recommendation:** Re-check after any contract upgrade or ownership change, both of which can alter behaviour without changing this page.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The holder list from the security indexer adds up to 227.5% of supply, so it does not describe real balances. That happens with rebasing and reflection tokens, whose balances change without transfers, and with contracts that report balances they do not hold. Concentration is unknown and priced as an unknown — neither a whale nor safe.

**Recommendation:** Check the largest holders on the block explorer, which reads current balances.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

46 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $122K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $275K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: fixed — the contract has no mint function. Control: an owner that could not be resolved. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $122K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (3/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ⚠️ Unknown |
| No Mint Function | ✅ Pass |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ Fail |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ⚠️ | Could not be determined from the explorer or on-chain reads — treat as unverified rather than safe. |
| No Mint Function | ✅ | No mint function — total supply cannot be inflated. |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ | Liquidity is **not locked** — this is a rug-pull vector. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
