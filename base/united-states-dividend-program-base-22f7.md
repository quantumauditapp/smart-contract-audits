## Audit Summary

The DERC20 contract is a standard ERC-20 implementation with additional governance and vesting features. The protocol relies on a centralized owner to manage inflation rates and pool access. While the code follows standard OpenZeppelin patterns, the high degree of administrative control poses a significant risk to token holders.

> **Final Recommendation:** It is recommended to transition the ownership of the contract to a multi-signature wallet or a decentralized governance contract to mitigate the risks associated with a single point of failure. Implementing a timelock on sensitive functions like updateMintRate and lockPool would provide transparency and allow the community to react to administrative changes.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 8/10 | Low | The architecture utilizes standard OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC-20, Votes, and Permits, ensuring robust base functionality. 7.1 Architecture and 7.2 Code Security are well-implemented, adhering to… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 3/10 | High | 7.4 Economic and 7.5 Governance aspects are heavily centralized under the contract owner. The owner has the ability to mint tokens and halt trading, which directly impacts token value and liquidity.… |
| **Upgrades** | 4/10 | Medium | 7.7 Upgrades are not supported as the contract is not a proxy. 7.8 Operations are straightforward, relying on the owner to trigger vesting and inflation events. The immutability of the contract logic… |

## Security Findings

_🟡 2 Medium · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `CP-01` — Centralized Minting Authority  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner has the ability to mint new tokens via the updateMintRate and release functions. This allows the owner to increase the total supply at their discretion, which can dilute the value of existing holdings.

**Recommendation:** Restrict minting capabilities to a pre-defined schedule or move the authority to a decentralized governance mechanism.


### `CP-05` — Centralized Control Over Token Transfers  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can use the lockPool and unlockPool functions to enable or disable token transfers. This gives the owner the power to effectively freeze user funds or halt market activity at any time.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability to pause transfers or implement a community-voted pause mechanism to prevent potential abuse.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The ten largest holders own 100.0% of supply. Of that, 3.8% burned — not holders that can sell, so excluded from the concentration score. What remains: 16.2% in wallets, 80.0% in other contracts. The deployer/owner wallet itself holds 16.2%. 219 holders in total.

**Recommendation:** Watch the largest wallets that are not exchanges, pools or locks — those are the ones that can move the price.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

219 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $75K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $55K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Its name presents it as a stable-value coin, yet it trades at $0.03721 — it does not hold a peg. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: mintable with no on-chain cap found. Control: a ProxyAdmin contract. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $75K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (2/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ Fail |
| No Mint Function | ❌ Fail |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ Unknown |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ | Ownership **not renounced** — the deployer retains control over parameters. |
| No Mint Function | ❌ | **Mint function present** — supply can be inflated by the owner. |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ | Could not be determined from the explorer or on-chain reads — treat as unverified rather than safe. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
