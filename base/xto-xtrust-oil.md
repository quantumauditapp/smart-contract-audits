## Audit Summary

The DERC20 contract is a standard ERC-20 token with additional governance and vesting capabilities. The protocol exhibits centralized control, allowing the owner to mint tokens and restrict transferability. While the code follows standard OpenZeppelin patterns, the high degree of administrative privilege poses a significant trust requirement for token holders.

> **Final Recommendation:** To improve security, consider transitioning ownership to a decentralized governance model or a multi-signature wallet to prevent single-point-of-failure risks. Implementing a timelock on sensitive functions like updateMintRate would provide transparency and allow the community to react to significant changes in tokenomics.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|

| **Governance / Economics** | 2/10 | High | 7.4 Economic and 7.5 Governance aspects are heavily centralized under the contract owner. The owner has the authority to mint new tokens and toggle transferability, which directly impacts token… |

## Security Findings

_🟡 3 Medium · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `CP-01` — Centralized Minting Authority  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner has the ability to call updateMintRate and release to increase the total supply of the token. This allows the owner to dilute the holdings of all existing token holders at their discretion, provided they stay within the 2% annual cap.

**Recommendation:** Implement a timelock on all minting-related functions to ensure that any increase in supply is transparent and predictable for the community.


### `CP-05` — Centralized Control Over Token Transfers  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can use lockPool and unlockPool to enable or disable token transfers. This gives the owner the power to effectively freeze the liquidity of the token, preventing users from moving or selling their assets.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability to pause transfers or restrict this functionality to a decentralized governance vote to prevent potential abuse of power.


### `QA-LIQUIDITY` — Liquidity not locked  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Acknowledged)*

0.0% of the pool's LP is burned or time-locked. 100.0% is held, unlocked, by 1 address(es) other than the owner/deployer. One of them — a wallet, 0xaa73…7236 — holds 100.0% and can remove that share at once; who controls it is not visible on-chain, so it is not treated as an independent provider. Some pools are concentrated-liquidity (V3/V4) positions; shares above are by position as GoPlus reports them.

**Recommendation:** Check the lock's end date and beneficiary on the locker's own page before relying on it.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The ten largest holders own 100.0% of supply. Of that, 3.8% burned — not holders that can sell, so excluded from the concentration score. What remains: 16.2% in wallets, 80.0% in other contracts. The deployer/owner wallet itself holds 16.2%. 18 holders in total.

**Recommendation:** Watch the largest wallets that are not exchanges, pools or locks — those are the ones that can move the price.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

18 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $165K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $328K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: mintable with no on-chain cap found. Control: a ProxyAdmin contract. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $165K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (2/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ Fail |
| No Mint Function | ❌ Fail |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ Fail |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ | Ownership **not renounced** — the deployer retains control over parameters. |
| No Mint Function | ❌ | **Mint function present** — supply can be inflated by the owner. |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ | Liquidity is **not locked** — this is a rug-pull vector. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
