## Audit Summary

The DERC20 contract is a standard ERC-20 token with additional governance and vesting capabilities. The architecture relies heavily on a centralized owner account, which possesses significant control over token supply and transferability. While the code follows standard OpenZeppelin patterns, the centralization of power represents the primary risk factor for token holders.

> **Final Recommendation:** It is recommended to transition the owner role to a multi-signature wallet or a decentralized governance contract to mitigate the risk of a single compromised key. Additionally, implementing a timelock on sensitive functions like updateMintRate and lockPool would provide community members with visibility and time to react to administrative changes.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 8/10 | Low | The contract utilizes robust, battle-tested OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC-20 and governance functionality. 7.1 Architecture is modular, and 7.2 Code Security is high due to the use of standard… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 3/10 | High | 7.4 Economic and 7.5 Governance aspects are heavily centralized under the contract owner. The owner has the ability to mint tokens and halt transfers, which directly impacts holder value and… |
| **Upgrades** | 4/10 | Medium | 7.7 Upgrades are not supported as the contract is not a proxy. This ensures immutability of the logic, which is a positive security trait. No upgrade-related risks are present. |

## Security Findings

_🟡 2 Medium · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `CP-01` — Centralized Minting Authority  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can call updateMintRate and release to increase the total supply of the token. This allows the owner to dilute the holdings of all existing token holders at their discretion.

**Recommendation:** Restrict minting capabilities to a pre-defined schedule or move the authority to a decentralized governance voting process.


### `CP-05` — Centralized Transfer Control  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can call lockPool and unlockPool to toggle a switch that controls whether transfers are allowed. This gives the owner the power to freeze user assets or halt trading activity entirely.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability to arbitrarily pause transfers, or implement a multi-sig requirement to ensure that such actions require broad consensus.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The ten largest holders own 100.0% of supply. Of that, 3.8% burned — not holders that can sell, so excluded from the concentration score. What remains: 16.2% in wallets, 80.0% in other contracts. The deployer/owner wallet itself holds 16.2%. 3,017 holders in total.

**Recommendation:** Watch the largest wallets that are not exchanges, pools or locks — those are the ones that can move the price.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

3,017 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $80K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $380K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: mintable with no on-chain cap found. Control: a ProxyAdmin contract. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $80K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (2/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ Fail |
| No Mint Function | ❌ Fail |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ Unknown |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ | Ownership **not renounced** — the deployer retains control over parameters. |
| No Mint Function | ❌ | **Mint function present** — supply can be inflated by the owner. |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ | Could not be determined from the explorer or on-chain reads — treat as unverified rather than safe. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
