## Audit Summary

The DERC20 contract is a standard ERC-20 token with additional governance and vesting capabilities. The protocol relies on a centralized owner to manage inflation rates and pool access. While the code follows standard OpenZeppelin patterns, the high level of administrative privilege introduces significant centralization risks for token holders.

> **Final Recommendation:** To improve the security posture, consider transitioning the ownership to a multi-signature wallet or a decentralized governance contract (DAO). This would mitigate the risk of a single compromised private key causing unauthorized minting or locking of user funds.

Additionally, implement a timelock mechanism for all privileged functions, such as updateMintRate and lockPool. A delay period would provide the community with sufficient notice and the ability to react before significant changes to the token's economic parameters or transfer rules take effect.

## Security Findings

_🟡 2 Medium · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `CP-01` — Centralized Minting Control  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can call updateMintRate and release to increase the total supply of tokens. This allows the owner to unilaterally dilute the holdings of all existing token holders.

**Recommendation:** Implement a hard cap on the total supply or transition ownership to a decentralized governance model to prevent arbitrary inflation.


### `CP-05` — Centralized Transfer Control  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can call lockPool and unlockPool to toggle a switch that determines if transfers are allowed. This gives the owner the power to freeze user assets or halt trading at any time.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability for the owner to pause transfers or implement a community-voted pause mechanism to ensure the power is not abused.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The ten largest holders own 100.0% of supply. Of that, 3.8% burned — not holders that can sell, so excluded from the concentration score. What remains: 16.2% in wallets, 80.0% in other contracts. The deployer/owner wallet itself holds 16.2%. 2,310 holders in total.

**Recommendation:** Watch the largest wallets that are not exchanges, pools or locks — those are the ones that can move the price.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

2,310 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $92K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $222K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: mintable with no on-chain cap found. Control: a ProxyAdmin contract. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $92K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (2/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ Fail |
| No Mint Function | ❌ Fail |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ Unknown |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ | Ownership **not renounced** — the deployer retains control over parameters. |
| No Mint Function | ❌ | **Mint function present** — supply can be inflated by the owner. |
| Liquidity Locked | ⚠️ | Could not be determined from the explorer or on-chain reads — treat as unverified rather than safe. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
