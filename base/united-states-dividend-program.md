## Audit Summary

The DERC20 contract is a standard ERC-20 token with additional governance, voting, and vesting capabilities. The architecture relies heavily on a centralized owner role that possesses significant control over token supply and transferability. While the code follows standard OpenZeppelin patterns, the centralization of power presents a notable risk to token holders.

> **Final Recommendation:** It is recommended to transition the ownership of the contract to a decentralized governance model, such as a DAO or a multi-signature wallet, to mitigate the risks associated with a single privileged owner. Implementing a timelock on sensitive functions like updateMintRate and lockPool would provide transparency and allow the community to react to administrative changes.

## Category Ratings

| Category | Rating | Risk Level | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical** | 8/10 | Low | The contract utilizes well-audited OpenZeppelin libraries for ERC-20, voting, and permit functionality. 7.1 Architecture is modular, and 7.2 Code Security is high due to standard implementation… |
| **Governance / Economics** | 2/10 | High | 7.4 Economic and 7.5 Governance aspects are heavily centralized. The owner has the ability to mint tokens and halt transfers, which directly impacts token value and liquidity. While minting is capped… |
| **Upgrades** | 3/10 | High | 7.7 Upgrades are not supported as the contract is not a proxy. 7.8 Operations are straightforward, relying on the owner to manage the pool and minting schedule. No complex upgrade paths exist to… |

## Security Findings

_🟡 2 Medium · ⚪ 5 Informational_

### `CP-01` — Centralized Minting Authority  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can call updateMintRate and release to increase the total supply of tokens. This allows the owner to dilute existing token holders at their discretion, provided the annual cap is not exceeded.

**Recommendation:** Consider implementing a decentralized voting mechanism or a timelock for any supply-altering functions to ensure community oversight.


### `CP-05` — Centralized Control Over Transferability  *(Severity: Medium · Status: Unresolved)*

The owner can use lockPool and unlockPool to enable or disable token transfers. This gives the owner the power to freeze user assets or restrict liquidity at any time.

**Recommendation:** Remove the ability to pause transfers or restrict it to a decentralized emergency pause mechanism with a clear, transparent process for activation.


### `QA-HOLDERS` — Who holds the supply  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The ten largest holders own 100.0% of supply. Of that, 3.8% burned — not holders that can sell, so excluded from the concentration score. What remains: 16.2% in wallets, 80.0% in other contracts. The deployer/owner wallet itself holds 16.2%. 2,574 holders in total.

**Recommendation:** Watch the largest wallets that are not exchanges, pools or locks — those are the ones that can move the price.


### `QA-IDENTITY` — Not listed by any independent source  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

2,574 holders. Not listed by CoinGecko or any exchange GoPlus tracks. Nothing independent confirms who is behind this token, so every power its contract grants is scored at face value.

**Recommendation:** Match the contract address against the project's official channels before trading.


### `QA-MARKET` — The market for this token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

Liquidity $71K (DexScreener, all pools). 24h trading volume $34K (DexScreener, all pools).

**Recommendation:** Size any position to the liquidity and daily volume shown — they set how much you can sell and at what price.


### `QA-PROFILE` — Asset class: Project token  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

A token issued by a project for use, governance or fundraising. Scored on its contract and market facts. The class itself adds no points; the contract and market facts decide the score. Its name presents it as a stable-value coin, yet it trades at $0.03317 — it does not hold a peg. Basis: no class-specific evidence. Tokenomics — Supply: mintable with no on-chain cap found. Control: a ProxyAdmin contract. Code: not upgradeable (no proxy). Fees: no buy or sell tax. Market: $71K of DEX liquidity across 1 pools. Launch: under a day of market history.

**Recommendation:** Check the project's own documentation for what the token is used for; this report covers what the contract allows.


### `QA-RECENT` — Recently launched — less than a day of market history  *(Severity: Informational · Status: Acknowledged)*

The token's oldest DEX pool is less than a day old. Age is not part of the risk score — a new token is not a risky one by default — but a short history means fewer trades and holder changes behind the facts in this report.

**Recommendation:** Re-check ownership, liquidity and holder distribution as the token matures; those are the facts that move early.

## Security Flags (2/5 passed)

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ Pass |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ Fail |
| No Mint Function | ❌ Fail |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ Fail |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ Pass |

## Security Flags Detail

| Check | | What it means |
|-------|---|---------------|
| Contract Verified | ✅ | Source code is publicly verified on-chain — logic is auditable. |
| Ownership Renounced | ❌ | Ownership **not renounced** — the deployer retains control over parameters. |
| No Mint Function | ❌ | **Mint function present** — supply can be inflated by the owner. |
| Liquidity Locked | ❌ | Liquidity is **not locked** — this is a rug-pull vector. |
| Not a Proxy | ✅ | Not a proxy — the implementation cannot be silently swapped. |
